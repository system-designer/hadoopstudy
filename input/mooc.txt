A massive open online course (MOOC /muÀêk/) is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web.
[1] In addition to traditional course materials, such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets,
many MOOCs provide interactive courses with user forums to support community interactions among students,
professors, and teaching assistants (TAs), as well as immediate feedback to quick quizzes and assignments.
MOOCs are a recent and widely researched development in distance education,
[2] first introduced in 2006 and emerged as a popular mode of learning in 2012.[3][4]
